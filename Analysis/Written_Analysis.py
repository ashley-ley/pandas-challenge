# Results and Conclusions

#     This project involves analysis of district-wide standardized test results using Pandas DataFrames. The goal is to provide insights and identify trends in 
#     school performance to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future schcool budgets and priorities.

# The analysis of the school district data provides several insights into school performance and trends. 
# Here are two notable observations:

    # 1. School Type and Performance

        # Charter schools are consistently outperforming district schools in terms of average math and reading scores. This is consistent for the passing rates as well. 
        # The top performing schoosl are all charter schools, while the bottom performing schools are all district schools.
        # It was also noted that district schools have a larger student population than the charter schools. 
    
    # 2. School Spending and Performance 

        # Schools with lower "per capita" spending tend to have higher math and reading scores, along with a higher overall passing rate.
        # The highest-performing schools in terms of overall passing percentage belong to the lowest spending range per student, while the 
            # lowest-performing schools belong to the highest spending range.

# The results suggest that school type and spending do play a factor in how a student performs overall. Charter schools tend to achieve better results compared
# to district schools. Additionally, schools with a lower budget per capita demonstrates that effectively allocating funds plays a crucial role in student
# achievement. For a more detailed analysis and complete results, please refer to the Jupyter Notebooks "PyCitySchools.ipynb" in the "PyCitySchools" folder of this repository.
